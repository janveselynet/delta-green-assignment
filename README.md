# Backend home assignment for Delta Green

## Solution overview

This solution processes IoT telemetry data from MQTT, aggregates it into time-based snapshots, and reliably persists it to PostgreSQL via RabbitMQ.

### Highlights
* Modular Services: Database, Queue, and MQTT client logic are isolated into separate helper modules (database.ts, queue.ts, mqttClient.ts) to maintain clean separation of concerns and keep core logic readable.
* Collector & Writer Services: The collector buffers incoming MQTT topics, validates data freshness (maxDataAgeMs), computes snapshot metrics, and publishes frames to RabbitMQ. The writer consumes these messages and safely persists them to PostgreSQL using explicit acknowledgments (prefetch(1) and ack).
* Unit Testing (Jest): Automated tests cover core domain logic, such as computeWeightedStateOfCharge, ensuring mathematical edge cases and empty data states are handled correctly.
* CLI Options: Configurable runtime options (e.g., --carId, --tickIntervalMs) are handled via yargs with sensible defaults.

### Future Improvements
* Decoupled MQTT Parser: Extract topic-parsing and payload-normalization logic from collector.ts into a pure function and add comprehensive unit tests for various payload edge cases.
* Graceful Shutdown: Add proper process termination hooks (SIGINT/SIGTERM) to close MQTT, RabbitMQ, and Postgres connections gracefully.

# Assignment

## Overview

In this home assignment you are required to create a data pipeline which collects data from electric cars and inputs them into the database.

The data are coming from an MQTT broker and your task is to feed them through a RabbitMQ queue into a Postgres database.

## Running the services

Every service required to complete the assignment is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. To run it simply execute:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a Postgres database on local port `55432`, Mosquitto MQTT broker on port `51883`, RabbitMQ on port `55672` and helper script which will initialize the database tables and start the electrical car simulation. All important credentials for connecting to the services can be seen in the `docker-compose.yml` file itself.

## Data description

The data coming from MQTT include these important topics:

- `car/[carId]/location/latitude` - latitude component of current car's position
- `car/[carId]/location/longitude` - longitude component of current car's position
- `car/[carId]/speed` - current speed of the car in m/s
- `car/[carId]/gear` - the gear the car is currently in (values N,1,2,3,4,5,6)
- `car/[carId]/battery/[batteryIndex]/soc` - state of charge of given battery in the car as a percentage from 0-100
- `car/[carId]/battery/[batteryIndex]/capacity` - capacity of given battery in the car in Wh

The database contains a table called `car_state` with these columns:

```
id              serial primary key,
car_id          integer,
time            timestamp,
state_of_charge integer,
latitude        double precision,
longitude       double precision,
gear            integer,
speed           double precision
```

## Expected work

Finish files `collector.ts` and `writer.ts` in the `src` directory of this repo.

The collector should be able to take data from the MQTT broker and put them into an appropriate RabbitMQ queue. **Be aware that the data may be coming out of sync**. The gear is sent only when the driver changes it, speed is sometimes delayed and the battery info can be missing or come only for one battery at a time. Be sure to deal with this fact appropriately in a way the timeseries of the data in the database doesn't have missing **time** points and the granularity of the data is kept as required. However, it is important to realize that you are working with an external unstable data source and if it stops sending data we must be able to eventually recognize it.

Next, the writer should take the data from the RabbitMQ queue and insert them into the given database table.

At the end of the process the database should contain rows with **5 second granularity** of the car's data for the given timestamp. Moreover, in the database we want the gear to be an integer with values (0-6, where N=0), speed to be in km/h and have only one state of charge percentage. The overall state of charge should be computed as a weighted average of the underlying state of charge weighted by the batteries` capacity.

For this task you should work only with one car with id `1`. It has two batteries and you can assume their capacity doesn't change (upon reading it from the MQTT topic you can save it in the code as a constant). In more realistic scenario both the car id and its constant properties such as battery capacity would come from an external database.
